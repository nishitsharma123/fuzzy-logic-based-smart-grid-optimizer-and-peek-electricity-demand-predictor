# Fuzzy Logic Based Smart Grid Optimizer & Peak Electricity Demand Predictor

A full-stack project that forecasts peak electricity demand and optimizes smart grid operations using **fuzzy logic** and **machine learning**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project focuses on two main goals:

1. **Peak Electricity Demand Prediction** – using historical demand datasets and machine learning to forecast demand.  
2. **Smart Grid Optimization** – applying fuzzy logic rules to balance load, optimize resources, and reduce inefficiency.
